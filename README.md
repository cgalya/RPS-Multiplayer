# Rock Paper Scissors Multiplayer

A multiplayer version of the classic Rock Paper Scissors using Firebase.

Two players can play at a time.  Both pick either rock, paper, or scissors.  Each player can see only their own choice.  When both players have chosen, the game reveals who won or lost or whether a tie occurred.  There is also a chat window through which players can communicate with each other.
